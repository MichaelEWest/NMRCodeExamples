# NMRCodeExamples
These are a few examples of my simulations and coding experience from graduate school.  They were all written to be compared to experimental results.  The detailed ackground theory was learned from scratch, and the ability to implement it in code form was also learned from scratch.  There are three parts.

A simple demonstration of an NMR spectrum generator.  It is quantum mechanical in nature, and is described with matrix manipulation/linear algebra. The relative intensities of the transitions change as a function of temperature (T), and being able to predict these changes with this model has proven useful for furthering scientific discovery.
Experimentally, we were able to achieve incredibly low temperatures (T = 0.0015 Kelvin), and at these exotic conditions, the signals started to reflect this.
